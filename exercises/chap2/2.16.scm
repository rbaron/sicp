; This exercise asks us to debate why equivalent algebraic expressions
; may lead to different answers and whether there is a way of making a
; system that does not have that problem.

; As discussed on exercise 2.15, interval arithmetic is a different kind
; of world in which our "real number arithmetic" intuition not always match
; the reality. The wikipedia article on interval arithmetic [0] points out
; some pitfalls, such as the dependency problem also discussed on exercise
; 2.15.  It seems to be an inherent problem with interval arithmetic, though
; some more research would be desirable for a firmer answer. To be fair, it
; said this was a hard one!
